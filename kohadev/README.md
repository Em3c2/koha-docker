## Kohadev README

This Docker image builds on a Koha docker image `digibib/koha:$TAG` from Dockerhub and
includes a complete Koha development install setup from git source.

It is very simple to setup and ready for use.

It is also preinstalled with git-bz tools to patch from bugzilla and qa-tools for testing

Documentation can be found on project [wiki](https://github.com/digibib/koha-docker/wiki)
